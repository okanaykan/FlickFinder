## **Dataset Details**

### **Purpose of the Dataset**
This dataset is designed for projects such as movie analytics and recommendation systems. It consists of two files:
1. **tmdb_5000_movies.csv** - Contains detailed information about movies.
2. **tmdb_5000_credits.csv** - Contains information about the cast and crew members.

### **Content**
#### **tmdb_5000_credits.csv**
- **movie_id:** A unique identifier for the movie.
- **title:** The name of the movie.
- **cast:** A list of actors in the movie (in JSON format).
- **crew:** Details about the crew, such as the director, producer, and writer (in JSON format).

#### **tmdb_5000_movies.csv**
- **budget:** The budget for making the movie.
- **genre:** The genre of the movie, such as action, comedy, thriller, etc.
- **homepage:** A link to the movie's official website.
- **id:** An identifier that matches the `movie_id` in the first dataset.
- **keywords:** The movie's keywords or tags.
- **original_language:** The language in which the movie was made.
- **original_title:** The movie's original title before any translation or adaptation.
- **overview:** A short description of the movie.
- **popularity:** A numerical value indicating the movie's popularity.
- **production_companies:** The production companies involved in the movie.
- **production_countries:** The countries where the movie was made.
- **release_date:** The movie's release date.
- **revenue:** The worldwide revenue generated by the movie.
- **runtime:** The movie's duration (in minutes).
- **status:** The status of the movie, such as "Released" or "Rumored."
- **tagline:** The movie's tagline.
- **title:** The movie's title.
- **vote_average:** The average rating the movie received.
- **vote_count:** The total number of votes the movie received.

### **Dataset Story**
The dataset was created using data retrieved from TMDB's API. TMDB is a popular movie database where users can rate and review movies.

## **System Components**

### **Data Preparation**
1. **Data Cleaning:** Removing null values and merging datasets.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Extracting and combining features such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew into a single "tags" column.
3. **Text Preprocessing:** Removing spaces and converting text to lowercase.

### **Recommendation Algorithm**
1. **TF-IDF Vectorization:**
   - Converts text data into numerical vectors.
   - Assigns weight to words based on frequency and importance.
2. **Cosine Similarity:**
   - Measures the similarity between movies based on their vectorized tags.
   - Outputs a similarity score to rank movies.

### **App Features**
